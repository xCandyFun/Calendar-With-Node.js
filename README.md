# Calendar-With-Node.js

I use insomnia to GET,POST,PUT and DELETE on the calender.

To POST
{
	"title":"test",
	"start":"year-month-day",
	"end":"year-month-day"
}

To GET,POST,PUT and DELETE use the url below:

http://localhost:8081/api/events

http://localhost:8081/api/events/{ID}
